## Introduction

*C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. You will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.*

In this project, students were challenged to recreate a set of functions that already exist within the Standard C Library, among some custom ones.
