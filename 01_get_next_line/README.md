# get_next_line

## Introduction

*This project is about programming a function that returns a line
read from a file descriptor. May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.*

This is particularly valuable project that helps students understand the concept of static variables and file descriptors. A good start would be to investigate those concepts.
